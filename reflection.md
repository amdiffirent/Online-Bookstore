# Reflection on GitHub Kanban Board

## Challenges Encountered
While setting up the GitHub Kanban board, the main challenge was understanding the functionality of the board and how it aligns with Agile principles. Customizing the board to include the **Testing** and **Blocked** columns was straightforward, but figuring out how to track and move tasks through those stages took some time since no tasks had reached those phases yet. This was a good exercise in understanding how to track the progress of tasks from **Backlog** to **Done**.

## Comparing GitHub Kanban to Other Tools
I also compared GitHub Kanban to other popular project management tools like **Trello** and **Jira**:

- **Trello**: Trello is highly flexible and user-friendly, allowing easy drag-and-drop functionality for tasks between columns. It’s more intuitive for personal or small team use but lacks built-in Agile features like sprint planning or automated workflows.
  
- **Jira**: Jira is an industry-standard tool for Agile project management, offering robust features like sprint tracking, backlog management, and detailed reporting. However, it’s more complex and requires a learning curve compared to GitHub Kanban.

In comparison, GitHub Kanban strikes a balance between simplicity and essential Agile features, especially for small-to-medium teams working in a collaborative environment. It’s well-suited for tracking user stories, progress, and handling workflow without needing advanced configurations.

## Lessons Learned
Through this exercise, I’ve learned how powerful and versatile GitHub Projects can be for managing an Agile workflow. I’ve gained hands-on experience in:
- Customizing Kanban boards to suit project needs.
- Using GitHub Issues for task management and linking tasks to the Kanban board.
- Adapting the board to fit the Agile process, especially with custom columns like **Testing** and **Blocked**.

This task also helped me understand the importance of visualizing workflows and limiting work in progress to ensure a smooth and efficient development cycle. By maintaining clear task statuses, it became easier to track progress, identify bottlenecks, and keep the team focused on priority tasks.
