# ✨ REFLECTION – Assignment 15

## 🎓 What I Learned

Even though I couldn’t submit actual pull requests due to time limitations, this assignment helped me:
- Understand open-source workflows (forking, branching, submitting PRs).
- Plan realistic, scope-limited contributions like documentation, tests, and small fixes.
- Recognize how much value small changes can add in a collaborative coding ecosystem.

## ⚠️ Challenges

- **Time Constraint**: This was the main barrier. I had multiple deadlines across other modules and simply could not allocate time for coding, testing, and submitting high-quality pull requests.
- **Limited Feedback Loops**: Since I didn’t submit PRs, I missed the opportunity to engage in review feedback or real CI checks.

## 🧠 Takeaways

- Contribution doesn't always mean code — issue tracking, planning, and documentation are just as important.
- I gained confidence to contribute to open source in future scenarios and better understand collaborative development best practices.

## ✅ Next Steps

After the semester, I plan to revisit these repositories and submit the contributions I outlined, using the work I pre-planned in this assignment.
