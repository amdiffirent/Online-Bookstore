## Reflection: Challenges in Identifying Stakeholders and Gathering Requirements

### 1. Choosing the Right Stakeholders
One of the first challenges was **identifying who the stakeholders should be**. At first, it seemed straightforward—customers and bookstore owners were obvious choices. But as I dug deeper, I realized there were other important groups to consider, like inventory managers, developers, and even payment gateway providers. Deciding which stakeholders to include and which to leave out required careful thought. I had to ask myself:
- Who is directly impacted by the system?
- Who has an important role in its success?
- Are there any indirect stakeholders I might be overlooking?

This process taught me that stakeholder identification isn’t just about listing roles—it’s about understanding their unique needs and how they interact with the system.

### 2. Balancing Conflicting Needs
Once I had my list of stakeholders, the next challenge was **balancing their conflicting needs**. For example:
- **Customers** wanted a fast, easy-to-use platform with features like real-time search and quick checkout.
- **Bookstore Owners** were more concerned about cost-effectiveness and efficient inventory management.
- **Developers** prioritized maintainability and scalability.

Finding a way to address all these needs without compromising the system’s core functionality was tricky. I had to make trade-offs, like prioritizing features that would have the biggest impact on the majority of users while keeping the system simple and manageable.

### 3. Defining Clear Requirements
Another challenge was **turning stakeholder needs into clear, actionable requirements**. At first, I struggled with vague statements like “the system should be fast” or “the interface should be user-friendly.” I quickly realized that these weren’t specific enough to guide development. To fix this, I focused on:
- Using precise language (e.g., “The system shall load search results within 2 seconds”).
- Including acceptance criteria to define how each requirement would be tested and validated.

This shift helped me create requirements that were both meaningful and measurable.

### 4. Avoiding Scope Creep
As I brainstormed features and requirements, I noticed how easy it was to get carried away. For example, I started thinking about advanced features like AI-based recommendations or multi-language support. While these would be nice to have, they weren’t essential for the core functionality of the system. Staying focused on the **minimum viable product (MVP)** was a constant challenge, but it helped me avoid unnecessary complexity.
