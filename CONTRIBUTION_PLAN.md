# üõ†Ô∏è CONTRIBUTION PLAN ‚Äì Assignment 15

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note

Due to time constraints and overlapping academic deadlines, I was unable to submit actual pull requests to peer repositories. However, I thoroughly explored multiple projects I starred and forked during Assignment 14 and identified issues I could realistically have contributed to. Below is the strategy and plan I had in place.

## üéØ Planned Contribution Strategy

1. **Start with Documentation**
   - Fix README grammar, add badges, standardize structure (Features, Installation, Usage).
   - Use Markdown best practices and ensure clarity for first-time visitors.

2. **UI or Minor Bug Fixes**
   - In the `Math-Booster` project: adjust button texts for grammar and improve consistency in layout labels.
   - Commented intention on the issues before starting, to respect collaboration norms.

3. **Write Tests for AI Learning Engine**
   - Add `pytest` unit tests in a `tests/` folder.
   - Simulate user input cases to ensure correct recommendations based on learning preferences.

4. **CI Awareness**
   - Planned to make sure all contributions would pass CI (GitHub Actions or similar).

Even though I couldn‚Äôt follow through on execution, this plan reflects my understanding of real-world contribution workflows.
