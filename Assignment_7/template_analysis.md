## 1.1  Comparison Table:
   | Template          | Columns (Workflow)            | Automation Features                          | Agile Suitability |
|------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------|
| **Basic Kanban**  | To Do, In Progress, Done    | No automation, manual task movement        | Simple Agile tracking but lacks automation |
| **Automated Kanban** | To Do, In Progress, Review, Done | Issues auto-move based on status | Best for Agile sprints due to automation |
| **Bug Triage**    | New Issues, Needs Triage, In Progress, Done | Auto-sorting of bugs/issues | Useful for maintenance, not for sprints |
| **Team Planning** | Icebox, Backlog, In Progress, Review, Done | Helps manage long-term planning | Better for high-level product roadmaps |


## 1.2 Justification for Choosing Basic Kanban 
The **Basic Kanban** template is the best fit for my Agile project because:  

1. **Flexible Task Management**  
   - Provides a simple workflow (*To Do, In Progress, Done*) that can be customized.  
   - Allows tracking of user stories and sprint tasks efficiently.  

2. **Supports Agile Workflows**  
   - Aligns with Agile principles by visualizing work in progress.  
   - Can be customized by adding columns like *Review* or *Blocked* to fit sprint needs.  

3. **Easy Adaptability**  
   - Since the *Automated Kanban* template is not available in GitHub Beta, this is the closest alternative.  
   - It allows manual control over task movement while still enabling Agile tracking.
