# Kanban Board Customization

### Custom Columns Added:
1. **Testing**: A column created to track tasks that are undergoing quality assurance and testing.  
   *(Currently, no tasks are in this column as no tasks have reached the testing phase yet.)*
   
2. **Blocked**: A column created to capture tasks that are unable to proceed due to external dependencies, issues, or obstacles.  
   *(Currently, no tasks are blocked, so this column is empty.)*

### Columns in Use:
- **Backlog**: Contains tasks awaiting prioritization.
- **Ready**: Tasks that are ready to be worked on.
- **In Progress**: Tasks actively being worked on by team members.
- **Testing**: Tasks that are in the quality assurance or testing phase.
- **Blocked**: Tasks that cannot move forward due to issues or dependencies.
- **In Review**: Completed tasks that are awaiting review and approval.
- **Done**: Fully completed and verified tasks.

### Explanation of Customizations:
- The **Testing** and **Blocked** columns were added to align with Agile practices and ensure better management of task flow.
- These columns will help identify any bottlenecks in the workflow, allowing the team to take timely action and resolve any issues quickly.
