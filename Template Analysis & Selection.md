## 1.1  Comparison Table:
   | Template          | Columns (Workflow)            | Automation Features                          | Agile Suitability |
|------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------|
| **Basic Kanban**  | To Do, In Progress, Done    | No automation, manual task movement        | Simple Agile tracking but lacks automation |
| **Automated Kanban** | To Do, In Progress, Review, Done | Issues auto-move based on status | Best for Agile sprints due to automation |
| **Bug Triage**    | New Issues, Needs Triage, In Progress, Done | Auto-sorting of bugs/issues | Useful for maintenance, not for sprints |
| **Team Planning** | Icebox, Backlog, In Progress, Review, Done | Helps manage long-term planning | Better for high-level product roadmaps |


## 1.2 Justification for Choosing Automated Kanban 
The **Automated Kanban** template is the best fit for our Agile project because:  

1. **Automation Enhances Workflow Efficiency**  
   - Tasks automatically move between columns based on their status, reducing manual effort.  
   - This supports Agileâ€™s principle of continuous progress tracking.  

2. **Sprint-Friendly Structure**  
   - The default columns (*To Do, In Progress, Review, Done*) align well with Agile sprints.  
   - The *Review* stage ensures quality control before completing tasks.  

3. **Better Visibility and Task Management**  
   - Provides real-time insights into task progress.  
   - Helps prevent bottlenecks by showing work distribution across stages.
