## Kanban Board Explanation

### What is a Kanban Board?  
A Kanban board is like a visual roadmap that helps teams organize and track their work. It as a big whiteboard with columns that represent the different stages of a task. As tasks move from one stage to the next, you can see exactly where things are at a glance.
### How Our Board Works

1. **Visualizes Workflow**  
   The columns represent different stages of our workflow:  
   - *Backlog*: Tasks waiting to be prioritized.  
   - *Ready*: Tasks that are ready to be worked on.  
   - *In Progress*: Tasks that are currently being developed.  
   - *Testing*: Tasks that are under quality assurance or testing.  
   - *Blocked*: Tasks that cannot proceed due to external dependencies or issues.  
   - *In Review*: Tasks that have been completed and are under review or approval.  
   - *Done*: Fully completed and verified tasks.

2. **Limits Work-In-Progress (WIP)**  
   By placing tasks in specific columns, we ensure that no column is overloaded with tasks at once. For example, we can limit the number of tasks in *In Progress* to 3, ensuring that team members focus on fewer tasks at once and avoid bottlenecks.

3. **Supports Agile Principles**  
   - **Continuous Delivery**: Tasks are moved across columns as they progress, providing a clear view of task status and ensuring a steady workflow.  
   - **Adaptability**: The board can easily be adjusted by adding columns like *Blocked* or *Testing* to meet changing project needs.  
   - **Collaboration**: Team members can easily see who is working on what and adjust priorities or assignments as needed.

### Why This Matters for Agile  
This board helps us maintain visibility of tasks, focus on completing one task at a time, and ensure that every task goes through all necessary stages (development, testing, review) before being considered done. By limiting WIP and having clear stages, we can achieve continuous progress and avoid bottlenecks.
